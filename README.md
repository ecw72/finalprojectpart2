# finalprojectpart2

This project focused on making a map of all grocery store and fast food locations in New Jersey. Origionally, it was supposed to calculate a ratio of grocery store to fast food stores, but this was too large for RShiny. Now it will just zoom in on an address one puts in. It also is a population heatmap!
